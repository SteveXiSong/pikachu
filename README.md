# pikachu
This pikachu project developed by ActivationIntelligence team.
Our team is founded by a software engineer and machine learning PhD student aiming at building a AI web service.
The service can provide AI/ML solutions to start-ups, research labs, small or medium companies who want to access to low cost, efficient machine learning models.

## Goals
Our goals are focused:
* Build highly avaible RESTful web service APIs to update data, get predictions.
* Build a model management backend that enable single machine learning engineer to manipulate tens, or hundreds of models easily. This will help reduce the marginal cost.
