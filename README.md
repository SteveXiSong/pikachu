This pikachu project is developed by ActivationAI team.
Our team is co-founded by a software engineer, a ML PhD student and a ML scientist aiming at building a AI web service.
The service can provide AI/ML solutions to start-ups, research labs, small or medium companies who want to access to low cost, efficient machine learning models, which is customized for their unique business purposes.

## Goals
Our goals are focused on:
* Building highly avaible, low latency RESTful services to get predictions from the costomized models.
* Building a model management backend that enable single machine learning engineer to manipulate tens, or hundreds of models easily.
* Communicating with clients to provide highly efficient and low-cost machine learning models to help their business grow fast an futher.
